PRD its nothing but project requirement document

figuring it what we are trying to build and where to stop

we are going to build project management plateform like jira


let setup a project

using npm init
you can modify everything later on

you will get a package.json

i have changed the script and add Dev element in that script object of package.json
in order to run the we have to type npm run dev

we your syntax has require then in the typr section of package.json 
add commonjs 
and if you want to work with import go with modules

i prefer modules


prettier inclusion
look we have installed prettier in order to make the entire code
look smooth and readable 

npx prettier . --write

you have to run this command in order to initialize and it will do the job

npx prettier . --check
this is to make changes 

"useTabs" : false,
this means dont use tabs for indexation prefer spaces
check .prettierc file for more info
